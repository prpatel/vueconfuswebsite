We will explore how Vue detects and reacts to changes, and how Vue compiles your templates into virtual DOM render functions. Based on this knowledge, we will then discuss how to unlock the full potential of Vue with advanced component patterns."},blakeWorkshop:{type:"talk",img:"/img/alexk.jpg",topic:"Vuex Demystified - Application State Management",author:"Alex Kyriakidis, Rolf Haug",social:[{github:"https://github.com/hootlex",twitter:"https://twitter.com/hootlex"}],authorInfo:"Authors of the VueSchool.io and The Vue.js Master Class",description:"In Vue.js is quite simple to work with components, and share data among them using events and props - especially in small to medium projects.

They help you structure and manage your application by glueing together your application logic and the interface. However, as an application grows, its components tend to get bigger and harder to reason about.                          This workshop will demonstrate how to efficiently design your components by focusing on maximum flexibility while avoiding premature optimisation. Throughout the workshop, we’ll build a set of components for a preexisting application. Following the evolving requirements, we will then perform a series of refactoring cycles to explore different possible solutions and patterns/anti-patterns. We’ll also talk about good practices for managing responsibilities of our components. By the end of the workshop, you should be able to write future-proof components that are easy to work with and resilient to changes."},vueVixens:{type:"talk",img:"/img/vuevixens.png",topic:"Vue Vixens Skulk",author:"The Vue Vixens",social:[{github:"https://github.com/vuevixens",twitter:"https://twitter.com/vuevixens"}],authorInfo:"Foxy people who identify as women",description:"Vueconf.US is pleased to partner with VueVixens to bring this full day Vue.js training as part of the event.
