We will explore how Vue detects and reacts to changes, and how Vue compiles your templates into virtual DOM render functions. Based on this knowledge, we will then discuss how to unlock the full potential of Vue with advanced component patterns."},blakeWorkshop:{type:"talk",img:"/img/alexk.jpg",topic:"Vuex Demystified - Application State Management",author:"Alex Kyriakidis, Rolf Haug",social:[{github:"https://github.com/hootlex",twitter:"https://twitter.com/hootlex"}],authorInfo:"Authors of the VueSchool.io and The Vue.js Master Class",description:"In Vue.js is quite simple to work with components, and share data among them using events and props - especially in small to medium projects. When an application starts growing, managing components state might become tedious and overwhelming. This is where Vuex comes to our rescue. Vuex is a state management pattern and official library for Vue.js applications. It serves as a centralized store for all the components in an application, with rules ensuring that the state can only be mutated in a predictable fashion.\n\nBy the end of the workshop, attendees will be able to develop elegant, debuggable, maintainable, and organized applications using a centralized store. No prior experience with Vuex is needed.\n\nWe will answer the common question “When should I use Vuex?” and work on real-world features."},sarahWorkshop:{type:"talk",img:"/img/sarah.jpg",topic:"Animated Interfaces with Vue.js",author:"Sarah Drasner",social:[{github:"https://github.com/sdras",twitter:"https://twitter.com/sarah_edo"}],authorInfo:"Senior Cloud Developer Advocate at Microsoft\nVue Core Team"},chrisWorkshop:{type:"talk",img:"/img/chris.jpg",topic:"Proven patterns for building Vue apps",author:"Chris Fritz",social:[{github:"https://github.com/chrisvfritz",twitter:"https://twitter.com/chrisvfritz"}],authorInfo:"Consultant\nVue Core Team",description:"In this workshop, we'll cover everything you need to know to get started building world-class Vue applications.

However, as an application grows, its components tend to get bigger and harder to reason about.                          This workshop will demonstrate how to efficiently design your components by focusing on maximum flexibility while avoiding premature optimisation. Throughout the workshop, we’ll build a set of components for a preexisting application. Following the evolving requirements, we will then perform a series of refactoring cycles to explore different possible solutions and patterns/anti-patterns. We’ll also talk about good practices for managing responsibilities of our components.
